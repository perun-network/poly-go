_poly-go_ provides generic helper functionality for golang projects. It is most prominently used by [PolyCrypt] in [go-perun] and [Erdstall]. 
Besides that everyone is free to use it in their projects as well ðŸ¤—

## Getting Started

Running _poly-go_ requires a working [Go distribution](https://golang.org), see `go.mod` for the required version.

```sh
# Clone the repository into a directory of your choice
git clone https://github.com/perun-network/poly-go.git
# Or directly download it with go
# go get -d perun.network/poly-go
cd poly-go
# Run the unit tests
go test ./...
```

You can import _poly-go_ in your project like this:

```go
import "polycry.pt/poly-go/test"
```

### Documentation

More in-depth documentation can be found on [go doc].
